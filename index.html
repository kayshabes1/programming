            <p>  My name is Kaysha Besi and I'm a web developer.
                 I'm going to take you through my educational background,
                 my work experience and why I decided to do a programming course.

                    <li>Educational Background</li>
                 Here's a list of all my educational credtitations:
                    <ul>
                        <li>GCE Advanced level- grades attained:BBC</li>
                        <li>Certificate of participation- Moringa School: Software development</li>
                    </ul> 
            </p>

                    <li>Work Experience</li>
                    </div>
                I have managed to get some work experience at Summit Lab.ltd as an intern.
                Here I was a technical assistant, helping around the office with various 
                technical problems. I did the internship at this firm for 4 months exactly.

                    <li>Why Programming?</li>
                </div>
                To be frank, I have no idea. I had given up on it when I was still ignorant and struggling. 
                Then I discovered how much I enjoy learning how stuff actually works. I wanted to know what 
                happens when you double click. I wanted to learn how some movement made by my wrist would 
                transfer to electrical pulses that would then make the cursor move on the screen.
                I wanted to create, to help. I wanted to change my world.
